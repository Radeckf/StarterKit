## Overview
SOLUCON is one of the leading IoT platforms and a powerful ecosystem.

## Information about hardware
### What is the IoT-Starter Kit for SOLUCON platform
Arduino is an open-source development platform for physical computing. It is intended for hobbyists, designers or anyone interested to build interactive objects.



## Setting up software
Arduino IDE 1.5.7


Download and install the Arduino IDE version 1.5.7, see instructions <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/software/">hier</a>. Versions lower then 1.5.7 will produce errors with some sketches as the compiler is too old.
Start the Arduino IDE once and quit the application again. This will create directory structures needed in the next steps.
